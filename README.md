Open_Camera_Rig
===============

Open Camera Rig is an Open Source Hardware Project designed to allow people with CNC machines and 3D printers to create affordable DIY camera cage/rig systems for mounting accessories such as monitors, follow focus, teleprompters, etc. This project is designed to make camera rigs affordable for all independent film maker.

Alex will create basic parts for his own use and release them to the public. These parts will be designed to be created by a 2.5D CNC machine. Alex has no 3D printer, so he hopes contributors will be able to help out and convert/adapt the parts for 3D printing.

Alex will create parts for the industry standard 15mm, 16mm (because 16mm is commonly used with CNC machines, therfore linear bearings and a lot of other cool stuff are readily avaialable for this size) and 19mm rod size, as well as "3/4" square rods" which can easily be DIY machined by a CNC machine (out of wood, to reduce costs.)

Alex's design philosophy for his parts. Metal is expensive so we will use 3/4" plywood, which should have more than adequate strength. Wood dowels will be tested for strength and usability, as they are much cheaper than aluminum rod. 

My design/prototyping plans over the next few months:

-Various linkages for 15/16mm rails, and 19mm "square rails" (that can be easily cut out of a 3/4 inch/19.05 mm wood sheet on a CNC)
-Teleprompter rig
-Geared Follow Focus
-Some slideable parts utilizing linear bearings (for example you've disassembled an anamorphic lens and want to mount and quickly slide the front lens to focus).
-Tripods/mounts

I will also have some design guidelines that I will personally follow:
-Parts must be able to be created on 2.5D CNC machine (possibly with very minor machining afterwards, like a couple drill press holes here and there, especially if you want to countersink holes for a cleaner finish etc)
-M5 and M8 hardware with hex sockets will be specified, so the rigs can be built with a couple Allen wrenches.
-Hopefully someone will come along that can convert the parts for 3D printing.

-For any structural component the wood must never be less than approx 10mm/CM (pocketing the 3/4" in half would give you 9mm, which is fine). I'm designing this to be sturdy and robust over light weight, since we're trying to additionally protect expensive fragile equipment.

DXF files of the parts will be provided on the GitHub, and likely Gcode to cut the parts out of 3/4" plywood at a reasonably safe speed and cut depth.

This is all in the VERY early stages, so if you stumbled across this site, give it a month or so to gain some traction! Alex (me!) still has to design/prototype/build the base components, take pictures to get others on board.

Have a great day,
