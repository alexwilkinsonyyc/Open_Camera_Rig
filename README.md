Open_Camera_Rig
===============

Open Camera Rig is an Open Source Hardware Project designed to allow people with CNC machines and 3D printers to create affordable DIY camera cage/rig systems for mounting accessories such as monitors, follow focus, teleprompters, etc. This project is designed to make camera rigs affordable for all independent film maker.

Alex will create basic parts for his own use and release them to the public. These parts will be designed to be created by a 2.5D CNC machine. Alex has no 3D printer, so he hopes contributors will be able to help out and convert/adapt the parts for 3D printing.

Alex will create parts for the industry standard 15mm, 16mm (because 16mm is commonly used with CNC machines, therfore linear bearings and a lot of other cool stuff are readily avaialable for this size) and 19mm rod size, as well as "3/4" square rods" which can easily be DIY machined by a CNC machine (out of wood, to reduce costs.)

Alex's design philosophy for his parts. Metal is expensive so we will use 3/4" plywood, which should have more than adequate strength. Wood dowels will be tested for strength and usability, as they are much cheaper than aluminum rod.
